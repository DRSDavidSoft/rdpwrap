# RDP Wrapper Library by Stas'M

## Important!

I will **_attempt_** to keep the rdpwrap.ini file updated as offsets are found for newer versions.  I will not, however, resolve any bugs or add additional features to the code.

RDPWInst.exe has been updated to point to the RDPWrap.ini (https://github.com/DrDrrae/rdpwrap/blob/master/res/rdpwrap.ini) file stored in my GitHub. No other changes have been made.  Download the update: https://github.com/DrDrrae/rdpwrap/releases/tag/v1.6.2.1

This is not my work. All the hard work belongs to stascorp (https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap).

I do not expect anyone to blindly trust this. You are free to use it at your own risk. I make no guarantees and take no responsibility for any ill effects.

## Important!
